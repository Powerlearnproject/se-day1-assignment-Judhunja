4. **Implementation**: Writing the code based on the design specifications.
5. **Testing**: Verifying that the software meets the requirements and works as expected.
6. **Deployment**: Releasing the software to the end-users.
7. **Maintenance**: Updating and fixing issues post-deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- **Waterfall Methodology**: This is a linear approach where each phase is completed before moving on to the next. It emphasizes predictability and control, with little room for changes once the project is underway.
- **Agile Methodology**: Agile is an iterative approach that emphasizes flexibility, continuous improvement, and collaboration. It allows for changes throughout the project lifecycle.

### Scenarios for Each Methodology

- **Waterfall methodology**: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, low risk of change, and strict regulatory compliance. For example, developing a safety-critical system for aerospace or a financial reporting system where predictability is crucial.

- **Agile methodology**: Ideal for projects with uncertain or evolving requirements, such as developing a mobile app where user feedback is essential for iterative improvements. Agile is also beneficial in environments where rapid deployment and continuous updates are necessary.
